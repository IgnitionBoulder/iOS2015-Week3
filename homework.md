## Shopping List Table View

This week will be your first time building an app from scratch. The goal is to integrate the struct, enum and class that we built last week into a table view app and display our shopping list.

#### Steps
# - Create a new single view app
# - Add a table view to your storyboard view
# - Add the ListItem and ShoppingList objects to the project. These are included for you in the __deliverables__ directory.
#- Store an instance of a ShoppingList in your ViewController
#- Add at least 5 items (with both name and quantity) to your shopping list. Make sure that they are in at least 2 different categories.
#- Display each item of your shopping list, grouped by category. Categories should be sorted by name and items within the category should be sorted by name. Be sure to display both name and quantity in each cell.
#- Add some flair. Change colors, fonts, etc.
